# Container runtime integration

To facilitate the deployment of vaccel-enabled applications, we integrate
vAccel to a popular container runtime,
[kata-containers](https://katacontainers.io).

Kata Containers enable containers to be seamlessly executed in sandbox Virtual
Machines. Kata Containers are as light and fast as containers and integrate
with the container management layers, while also delivering the security
advantages of VMs. Kata Containers is the result of merging two existing open
source projects: Intel Clear Containers and Hyper runV.

vAccel integration to kata comes in both modes: `virtio` and `vsock`. An
overview of the software stack is shown in Figure 1.

Our current, downstream implementation for Kata-containers v3.X includes support for the AWS Firecracker sandbox, and the `vsock` mode of vAccel. Visit our [downstream branch](https://github.com/nubificus/kata-containers/tree/vaccel-v3.0) to peak through the code or have a look at the [tutorial](kata_vaccel.md) to get a vAccel kata-containers runtime installed in your cluster.
