# Language bindings

You can use vAccel from more than C.

The vAccel core library itself is written in C, but you can use the vAccel API
from other popular programming languages through the provided bindings:

- [Python bindings](python-bindings/index.md)
- [Go bindings](go-bindings/index.md)
- [Rust bindings](rust-bindings/index.md)
