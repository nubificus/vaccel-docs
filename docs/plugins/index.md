# Plugins

vAccel plugins implement the operations of the vAccel User API.

There are two types of plugins:

- [Acceleration plugins](acceleration/index.md) that provide hardware-accelerated
  implementations of vAccel operations
- Transport plugins that implement transport mechanisms for vAccel
  (ie. for remote execution)
