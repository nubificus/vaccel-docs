# Available plugins

There are different types of plugins available:

- [Bundled plugins](bundled-plugins/index.md) that come with the core vAccel
  installation and are designed to help with development
- [Acceleration plugins](acceleration-plugins/index.md) that provide
  hardware-accelerated implementations of vAccel operations
- [Transport plugins](transport-plugins/index.md) that implement transport
  mechanisms for vAccel (ie. for remote execution)

Make sure vAccel is [installed](../../getting-started/installation.md) before
trying to use any of the plugins.
